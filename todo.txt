Shortcuts: Any suggestions (better than shift + g)

multiple graphs (1) 
    - Figure out where the multiple graph management should be displayed (Sidebar? Navbar? Along with Other Buttons?)
    - Then just a matter of saving and rendering JSON
rearrange entries (2)
    - Create arrows to move up and down? Make it a keyboard shortcut as well? Difficulty of draggables? 

auto draw snaps to grids
on cancel, delete graph? 

drag and drop to create edges?
edge curves?
    - if line over line
        - move node
