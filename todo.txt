bug testing!!! (especially indexeddb, modal, loading in graphs, graph saving, graph deletion)

code documentation
magic numbers

Improve Features:
New features:
- Rearrangeable entries
- Global adjustable font sizes for states and transitions
- Global and local shapes for states and transitions (squares, circles, diamonds, pentagons, hexagons, triangles)
- Revert to default button (resets all the colors, fonts, and shapes)
- Transitions that have no source / inducer state (might have to discuss how this will fit in with the final STR file - does the transition not appear, or does it come from NULL or something like that?)
- During transition creation, click on states to auto-fill source / target / inducer 
Potential features (still need to figure out how to implement)
- Shortcuts for everything else
- Ctrl-Z (Undo) feature
- Color-based legend
- Adjustable edge curves
