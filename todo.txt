bug testing!!! (especially indexeddb, modal, loading in graphs, graph saving, graph deletion)


code documentation
magic numbers

Shortcuts: Any suggestions (better than shift + g)

multiple graphs (1) 
    - Figure out where the multiple graph management should be displayed (Sidebar? Navbar? Along with Other Buttons?)
    - Then just a matter of saving and rendering JSON
    create: 
        - have input somewhere for name
        - don't really need to do much
    read: 
        - done? 
    update:
        - on selecting previous graph, some kind of visual indication
        - set all the data values, auto-save should now save to that id
    delete: 
        - delete entry, make sure everything is updated correspondingly
        - delete indexeddb entry
rearrange entries (2)
    - order is stored as a data attribute
    - Create arrows to move up and down? Make it a keyboard shortcut as well? Difficulty of draggables? 

auto draw snaps to grids

drag and drop to create edges?
edge curves?
    - if line over line
        - move node

name feature for saved graphs (also last modified time?)

refactor all entries to be under one entry
