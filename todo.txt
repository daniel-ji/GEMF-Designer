high priority
- bugtest (STR validation, STR load in)
- edit edges in graph and in form listing
- non overlapping graph, space out
- multiple STR file import 
    - only new nodes
    - override existing rates

lower priority (future potential ideas)
- look for magic numbers

question: json file download feature? (select both options) sessions feature? user accounts feature? 
question: going back to upload? editable text box feature for STR upload? clear everything? keep previous states? what if repeats / already existing nodes?
