bug testing!!! (especially indexeddb, modal, loading in graphs, graph saving, graph deletion)

code documentation
magic numbers

New features:
- Adjustable, global font size for states and transitions (one global font size for each of them)
- Global (default) and local shapes for states and transitions (squares, circles, diamonds, pentagons, hexagons, triangles)
- Revert to default button (resets all the colors, fonts, and shapes)
- Transitions that have no source / inducer state (how will this will fit in with the final STR file - does the transition not appear, or does it come from NULL or something like that?)
- Shortcuts for everything else (auto-draw, download, delete?)
- Ctrl-Z (Undo) feature
- Color-based legend
- Adjustable edge curves

- with shapes, still need to:
    - figure out arrow length
    - create global shape option 
    - create local shape option (in node inputs form page)
