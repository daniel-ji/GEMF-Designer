high priority
- bugtest (STR validation, STR load in)
- edit edges in graph and in form listing

lower priority (future potential ideas)
- look for magic numbers

question: json file download feature? sessions feature? user accounts feature? 
question: going back to upload? editable text box feature for STR upload? clear everything? keep previous states? what if repeats / already existing nodes?
