code documentation
magic numbers

rename str option
exclude existing nodes from auto-draw str
Undo feature for STR import

features to add:
- Adjustable edge curves
    - probably have to make an "edge" into four nodes
    - learn some stuff about cubic beziers

- Color-based legend (probably have to ask Jonathan some more)

- with shapes, still need to:
    - triangle shape dilemma

- preset STRs?
