high priority
- bugtest (STR validation, STR load in)
- edit edges in graph and in form listing
    - for graph: go to add edges page, automatically open up edge entry for editing
        - only if there's no error (need to implement, check TODO)
- multiple STR file import 
    - only new nodes
    - override existing rates
    - entry for each stl file import

lower priority (future potential ideas)
question: json file download feature? (select both options) sessions feature (indexeddb https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)? user accounts feature? 
question: going back to upload? editable text box feature for STR upload? clear everything? keep previous states? what if repeats / already existing nodes?
