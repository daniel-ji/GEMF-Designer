bug testing!!! (especially indexeddb, modal, loading in graphs, graph saving, graph deletion)

code documentation
magic numbers

features to add:
- Adjustable edge curves
    - probably have to make an "edge" into four nodes
    - learn some stuff about cubic beziers

- Ctrl-Z (Undo) features
    - store a history of node positions (in an efficient manner)
    - on node movement or auto-draw, check if the node positions changed, and if so, add to the undo "stack"
        - if this is not a redo or undo, clear the redo stack
    - on undo, revert to the previous history log and add the top to the redo "stack"
    - on redo, revert to the previous history log and add the top to the undo "stack"

- Color-based legend (probably have to ask Jonathan some more)

- with shapes, still need to:
    - triangle shape dilemma
