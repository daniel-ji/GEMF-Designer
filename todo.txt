bug testing!!! (especially indexeddb, modal, loading in graphs, graph saving, graph deletion)

code documentation
magic numbers

rearrange entries (2)
    - order is stored as a data attribute
    - Create arrows to move up and down? Make it a keyboard shortcut as well? Difficulty of draggables? 

auto draw snaps to grids

drag and drop to create edges? click on node to select? 
edge curves?
    - if line over line
        - move node

discuss with jonathan: 
clear graph when creating a new one? the interaction existing data and graph creation
Shortcuts: Any suggestions (better than shift + g)
