high priority
- multiple STR file import
    - TEST: only new nodes
    - TEST: override existing rates
    - TEST: entry for each stl file import
    - TODO: strikethrough, deleted node link from strs
- refactor form error

lower priority (future potential ideas)
- sort / rearrangement of links / nodes
- select multiple and move
- edit edges in graph
    - automatically open up edge entry for editing
    - only if there's no error (need to implement, check TODO)
- session feature w/ indexeddb:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API
- download vis graphic
- delete confirmation
- undo node delete
- auto-draw feature
- error prompts for target, source, rate addedgeentry

question: destructive nature of importing STRs (overriding)
