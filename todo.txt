bug testing!!! (especially indexeddb, modal, loading in graphs, graph saving, graph deletion)

code documentation
magic numbers

New features:
- Transitions that have no source / inducer state (how will this will fit in with the final STR file - does the transition not appear, or does it come from NULL or something like that?)
- Revert to default button (resets all the colors, fonts, and shapes)
- Adjustable, global font size for states and transitions (one global font size for each of them)
- Color-based legend
- Adjustable edge curves

- Ctrl-Z (Undo) feature (gotta think about this one) (recording changes in data?, just graph? also form actions? which form actions)

- with shapes, still need to:
    - triangle shape dilemma
